            1.Differences between uncontrolled and controlled components?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (a)A controlled component is a component that is controlled by React
            state, while an uncontrolled component is a component that maintains
            its own internal state.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4   font-medium text-xl">
            (b)In controlled components, all event handling is done in the
            parent component. The parent component receives the event and
            updates the state accordingly whereas, uncontrolled components, the
            event handling is done in the component itself. The component
            listens for events and updates its internal state accordingly.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (c) Controlled components can be slower than uncontrolled components
            because of the extra layer of indirection. However, they offer
            better control and maintainability whereas, Uncontrolled components
            can be faster than controlled components, but they can be harder to
            maintain and debug since the state is not controlled by the parent
            component.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (d) Controlled components are useful when you need to have a high
            degree of control over the user input in your application, whereas
            Uncontrolled components, on the other hand, are useful when you want
            to let the user input data freely and don't need to validate it
            before submission.

            2.How to validate React props using PropTypes?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (a)We you need to import the PropTypes module from the 'prop-types'
            package.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (b)Define the propTypes for component by adding a propTypes object
            to component.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (c)In the propTypes object, define the type and validation rules for
            each prop using PropTypes validators.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (d)Use advanced validators, such as PropTypes.shape or
            PropTypes.oneOfType, to validate more complex props.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (e)If a prop fails validation, PropTypes will log a warning message
            to the console. By using PropTypes to validate your props, we can
            catch errors early and ensure that your components receive the
            correct props.

            3.Tell us the difference between nodejs and express js.
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (a)Nodejs is a runtime environment that allows you to execute
            JavaScript code on the server-side whereas,Expressjs is a web
            framework built on top of Node.js.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (b)Nodejs provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that
            makes it ideal for building scalable, high-performance applications
            whereas, Expressjs provides a set of tools and utilities that make
            it easier to build web applications and APIs.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (c)Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine used in
            Google Chrome, which makes it extremely fast and efficient whereas,
            Express.js provides a set of middleware functions that can be used
            to handle HTTP requests and responses, parse request data,
            authenticate users, and more. It also provides a routing system that
            allows you to define URL routes and map them to functions that
            handle requests.

            4.What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (a) a custom hook is a reusable function that can contain stateful
            or stateless logic and can be shared between multiple components.
            Custom hooks are created using the use prefix, which indicates to
            React that it is a hook.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (b)It is used for to create a custom hook to encapsulate that logic
            and make it reusable across components.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (c)If application makes API calls in multiple components, we can
            create a custom hook to abstract the API calls and handle the
            loading, error, and data states in a consistent way.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (d)We can create a custom hook to handle reading and writing to
            local storage, making it easier to manage persistent data in
            application.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-medium text-xl">
            (e)We can improve the separation of concerns in codebase, making
            components simpler and easier to understand.
